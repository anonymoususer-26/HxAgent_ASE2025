RULE #1: After selecting new dates in the calendar interface, verify that the dates displayed in the main search interface are updated to match the selected dates before clicking the search button. For example, if January 10-15 was selected in the calendar but the main interface still shows December 30-January 6, the dates were not properly confirmed.
RULE #2: When selecting dates in the calendar interface, ensure both departure and return dates are highlighted in blue before clicking 'Done' to confirm the selection. For example, if only one date is highlighted while the other shows a default selection, the date selection is incomplete.
RULE #3: When entering destination/departure cities, select the main international airport option (indicated by 'Intl.' or largest airport) rather than 'All Airports' option to ensure more accurate flight results. For example, choose 'JFK - John F. Kennedy Intl.' over 'NYC - All Airports' or 'LHR - Heathrow' over 'LON - All Airports'.
RULE #4: When selecting dates in the calendar interface, ensure the selected dates are within the same calendar view (visible months) to avoid confusion. For example, if selecting dates across different months, both months should be visible simultaneously in the calendar interface to prevent accidental date selection.
