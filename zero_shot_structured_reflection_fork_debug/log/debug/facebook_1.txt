cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: facebook_1. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

cur_plan_prompt %s You are operating a computer for a task: facebook_1. You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections. If dropdownlist is available, you can "press ARROWUP x N" or "press ARROWDOWN x N" to press the arrow key N times to iterate over list items, and then "press ENTER" to select the current item.

There are three types of atomic actions you can perform. Firstly, you can click an object by referring to its id, such as "click id=...". Secondly, you can enter text to an input field, such as "enter "..." to id=...". Specifically, you should always wrap the text you want to type in with double quotes. Lastly, you can operate special keys on the keyboard, such as "hold CTRL" and "release CTRL" before and after multiple selections.
